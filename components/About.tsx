        A few years ago, when my parents moved to Canada, they struggled to
        build their credit history despite being financially responsible. I saw
        firsthand how confusing the system was and how it limited opportunities.
        Realizing that many other adults faced the same challenge, I wanted to
        create a solution. This web app simplifies credit building, offering
        step-by-step guidance to help users take control of their financial
        future.
